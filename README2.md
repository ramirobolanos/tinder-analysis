The purpose of this project is two-fold:

    1. Can we harness the power of online dating to land me a job?
    2. Can I find a statistically significant insight on Tinder users based on a activity

Right off the bat, I'd like to calculate some fun stats such as:

    1. Number of daily matches
    2. Average conversation length 
    3. Best time to "Tinder" based on messages sent and received 
    4. Sentiment analysis of conversations
